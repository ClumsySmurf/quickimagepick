# QuickImagePick

Easy to use and customizable image pick for Android.
 
* Pick image from gallery
* Use Documents app (API 19+) to pick image from gallery, cloud storage etc.
* Take picture with device camera (using existing apps)
* Mix and match: allow user to choose from any combination of above
* Save `Uri` content to a `File`
* Allow only local content to be picked
* Set allowed MIME types of files that can be picked (single for pre KitKat, multiple Kitkat onwards)
* Single call to get MIME type and file extension of picked image (from returned Uri)
* Supports activities and fragments (both plain and support ones)

## Why this library?

* More functionality (numerous useful operations with `Uri`, multiple pick options, etc) 
* It works with content data type rather than filesystem (solving `FileUriExposedException` issue of using latter)

## Usage

### Step 1: import Gradle dependency

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
    
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.aviadmini:quickimagepick:1.3.0'
}
```

### Step 2: trigger pick flow 

#### Show gallery apps to choose picture
- Use one of `QuickImagePick.pickFromGallery(...)` methods
- Choose allowed MIME types of files that can be picked

#### Choose picture using Documents app
- Use one of `QuickImagePick.pickFromDocuments(...)` methods
- Note: on pre-KitKat this will show file manager apps to choose a picture
- Choose allowed MIME types of files that can be picked

#### Show camera apps to take a picture
- Use one of `QuickImagePick.pickFromCamera(...)` methods
- You can change the directory where pictures are saved by calling `setCameraPicsDirectory(Context pContext, String pDirPath)`, set to `null` to use default (pictures directory on external storage) 
- **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: library does not delete the images taken by camera. You must do it yourself after you're done with them to prevent using too much storage space** 
- Default settings don't need `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission. But if you want to save camera pics to a different location you might need to grant the permission
- Library **does not** need CAMERA permission. **However** if you have it declared in your Manifest, you must grant it to use `pickFromCamera(...)` methods. Refer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32789027/android-m-camera-intent-permission-bug)

#### Use a combination of above by specifying which types to show `PickSource.CAMERA`, `PickSource.GALLERY` and/or `PickSource.DOCUMENTS` (refer to sample app for usage)
- `QuickImagePick.pickFromMultipleSources(...)`

### Step 3: Get your picture `Uri`

```java
final QuickImagePick.Callback mCallback = new QuickImagePick.Callback() {

    @Override
    public void onImagePicked(@NonNull final PickSource pPickSource, final int pRequestType, @NonNull final Uri pImageUri) {

        Log.i(TAG, "Picked: " + pImageUri.toString());

        // Do something with Uri, for example load image into and ImageView
        Glide.with(getApplicationContext())
             .load(pImageUri)
             .fitCenter()
             .into(mImageView);

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull final PickSource pPickSource, final int pRequestType, @NonNull final String pErrorString) {

        Log.e(TAG, "Err: " + pErrorString);

    }

    @Override
    public void onCancel(@NonNull final PickSource pPickSource, final int pRequestType) {

        Log.d(TAG, "Cancel: " + pPickSource.name());

    }

};

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(final int pRequestCode, final int pResultCode, final Intent pData) {
super.onActivityResult(pRequestCode, pResultCode, pData);
    super.onActivityResult(pRequestCode, pResultCode, pData);
    
    QuickImagePick.handleActivityResult(getApplicationContext(), pRequestCode, pResultCode, pData, this.mCallback);
            
}
```

### Dessert

#### Save content from `Uri` to a `File`

```java
QuickImagePick.saveContentToFile(Context, Uri, File) throws IOException;
```

#### Allow only local content to be picked

```java
QuickImagePick.allowOnlyLocalContent(boolean);
```

#### Set allowed MIME types of files that can be picked (gallery/documents)

```java
QuickImagePick.setAllowedMimeTypes(Context, String...);
QuickImagePick.setAllowedMimeTypes(Context, List<String>);
QuickImagePick.setAllowedMimeTypes(Context, Set<String>);
QuickImagePick.setAllImageTypesAllowed(Context);
```

#### Get MIME type or common file extension of an `Uri`

```java
QuickImagePick.getUriMimeType(Context, Uri);
QuickImagePick.getUriFileExtension(Context, Uri);
```

#### Delete content specified by `Uri`

```java
QuickImagePick.deleteContent(Context, Uri);
```

### Vector

There's a few extension ideas that might make the library even more useful. 

- explicit integration with file pickers
- custom camera module
- tell me more ;)

If your app uses this library send me market links ;)
